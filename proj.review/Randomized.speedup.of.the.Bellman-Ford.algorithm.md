## Summary

This presentation talks about a speed up algorithm of bellman-Ford algorithm.

They first established that the change is based on constant time improvements, thus the big O notation is still `O(n^3)`. 
An intuitive improvement is that after `i`-th iteration, `i` destination should be minimized, thus the loop time can be redused. 
Yen's algorithm further reduced the loop time from `|V|-1` to `|V|/2`.

This papre further improved Yen's algorithm. 
The selection of the edges are random.
They proved that with probability at least `1-1/n^c`, the relaxations is at most `nm/3 + m`.
