\section*{Q6: LCP}

Given $LCP(Suff_k,Suff_j)=y$ and $S[k-1]=S[j-1]$
What is the value of $LCP(Suff_k,Suff_j)$?

\subsection*{Solution}

Note: I think the problem has a typo.
Asking $LCP(Suff_k,Suff_j)$ doesn't make sense, I think you meant to ask $LCP(Suff_{k-1},Suff_{j-1})$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The value of $LCP(Suff_k,Suff_j)$: $y = 7$.
    \item The value of $LCP(Suff_{k-1},Suff_{j-1})$: $y + 1 = 8$.
\end{enumerate}
