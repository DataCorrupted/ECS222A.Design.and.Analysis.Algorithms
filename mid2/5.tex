\section*{Q5: FPT}

What if your algorithm for k- vertex covered FPT changed to the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
VC(G,k):
    if(E=\empty) return true;
    if(E>=k*n) return false
    select 2 edges (u,v) and (u',v') from E
    //if only edge left select the same edge twice
    a=VC(G-u,k-1);
    b=VC(G-v,k-1);
    c=VC(G-u',k-1);
    d=VC(G-v',k-1);
    return a OR b OR c OR d
\end{lstlisting}

What is the runtime of the algorithm? is it still FPT?

\subsection*{Solution}

$$T(k) = 2N(N-1)T(k-1)$$
Thus we have $T(k) = O(N^{2k})$.

But yes, it is still FPT, i.e. we can trace back the calling stack to find the solution if the answer is True.
