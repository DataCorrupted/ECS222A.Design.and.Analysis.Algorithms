You are deciding which algorithm to implement, given a patterns $P$ and a text $T$ such that

You are given the following requirements: Pattern size is always $|P|=n^2$ Text such that $|T|=n^6$.
You will be performing $X$ different searches for $X$ different patterns such that $X=n^y$

What is the total create+search time:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using suffix tree: given you create suffix tree in $O(n^2)$.
    \item Using suffix array: given you already have a suffix tree already created at a cost of $O(n)$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using suffix tree, each search time would be $O(n^6)$ for each search, since $X = n^6$, the total time would be $O(n^6 * n^6 + (n^6)^2) = O(n^{12})$
    \item Using suffix array, the array length would be $O(n^6 - n^2) = O(n^6)$.
          Using binary search, the search time for each would be $O(\log n^6) = O(\log n)$.
          Given $O(n^6)$ searches, the total search time would be $O(n^6 \log n)$, which dominates creation time $O(n^6)$.
          Thus the total time would be  $O(n^6 \log n)$.
\end{enumerate}
